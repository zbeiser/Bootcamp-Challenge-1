# Bootcamp-Challenge-1

## Description

The objective of this project was to provide a lesson in the importance of refactoring websites. This project involved refactoring the HTML and CSS files of a website for a company offering digital media optimization services. The original code included instances of nonsemantic elements, redundant CSS, and elements that didn't meet accessibility standards. Through the refactoring process, I was able to make the website's code more accessible, consdolidated, and follow better semantic structure, all without changing the visual appearance of the webpage itself.

## Installation

Use this website's code as an example in how to write HTML and CSS in a semantic, accesssible, and consolidated manner. Access the HTML and CSS files through a code editor, or open the page in a browser and utilize browser development tools to examine the contents of the code.
